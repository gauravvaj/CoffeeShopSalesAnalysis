# CoffeeShopSalesAnalysis
This repository contains all the files related to project Coffee Shop Sales Analysis. In this project I have tried to get some insights out from Coffee Shop Sales data and present them in a form of a Dashboard . It is a pure MS-Excel based project in which every component like Data Cleaning , Data Transformation , Data Analysis and Dashboarding was done with the help of varied features of MS-Excel. This project involved following steps: /n
Step1: Firstly raw data was imported to Excel using "Get Data" option . /n
Step2: Power Querry Editor was used for necessary data cleaning and transformations. /n
Step3: Pivot tables were made to get some useful insights from the data. /n
Step4: Important Measures were created in Power Pivot to give us important KPIs./n
Step5: Charts and Visualization were created from pivot tables and measures to form a Dashboard.
